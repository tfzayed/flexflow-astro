##### About Coderwall

The beginning of the day is vitally important to how the rest of your day is likely to go. If you don’t want to get up on the wrong side of the bed, make it a habit to start your day off with a motivational quote or even more than one. It can help put you in the right frame of mind so that you have a much more positive day than you would've otherwise had. Everyone needs a little help to get the day started on a positive note, and there's nothing better to do this than a good cup of coffee and an inspirational and motivational quote.

##### It's always nice

Using a motivational quote that speaks to you is a great way to start a journal page or begin your writing for the day. Just having that first quote to get the ideas going is an invaluable tool - you never know where that one idea will take you. In addition sometimes writers tend to pick a quote or subject that they're more familiar with. Since you won’t know what the inspirational quote will be or who the author is beforehand, it may force you to be more creative and think in a new direction about the idea.
